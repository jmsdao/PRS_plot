# What we are doing
- We are following a portion of a tutorial outlined in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0353-1.
- The portion we are following is running a PRS analysis of height, using simulated data.
- We will take data files provided, do necessary data wrangling to get the data in the right format.
- After the data is in the right format, we will perform PRS using PRSice-2.
- We will run a scatter plot of our results, and compare it to sample results.

# Requirements

- Download PRSice-2 from [this link](https://www.prsice.info/), and place it in the same directory as the contents of this notebook.
  - Note: depending on your OS, you will need to download the correct executable and adapt some of the code provided in this notebook.
  - Windows users can use the Linux executable via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
